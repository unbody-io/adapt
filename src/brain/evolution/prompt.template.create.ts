${guidance}

# Instructions
Generate ONE specialist configuration that covers the domain described above.
A single broad specialist is better than multiple narrow ones — the network
can split it later when the specialist has enough knowledge to differentiate.

Provide:
- id: kebab-case identifier
- name: human-readable display name
- description: brief description for routing (what questions this specialist answers)
- instructions: structured instructions with a core directive, watch conditions, and questions to track
- type: one of:
${typeList}`
}
