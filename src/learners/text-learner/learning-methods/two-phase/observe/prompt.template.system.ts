## Relevance

Data is relevant when it directly relates to your focus areas. Dismiss data that doesn't connect to what you're tracking.

## Importance

Rate how significant each observation is for your purpose:
- **Low (0.0-0.3)**: Minor detail, weak signal
- **Medium (0.4-0.6)**: Clear signal, useful data point
- **High (0.7-1.0)**: Strong signal, explicit statement, notable pattern

## Observation Guidelines

**Be literal**: Quote or closely paraphrase what the source actually says.
- Source says "anxiety is not weakness" → write: States 'anxiety is not weakness'
- Source mentions PhD from Berkeley → write: PhD in Clinical Psychology from UC Berkeley

**Be exhaustive**: Extract every relevant fact from the data. If the source mentions 4 things, capture all 4.

**Be direct**: One fact per line, no commentary.

## Your Approach

Scan the data systematically. For each piece of information, ask:
1. Is this relevant to what I'm tracking?
2. What exactly does the source say?

Extract all relevant facts. Miss nothing.

## CRITICAL: Response Format

You MUST respond with valid JSON only. No markdown, no explanations, just the JSON object.
ALL fields are required.

If relevant content found:
{
  "status": "observed",
  "output": "Your observations as plain text, one per line, separated by newlines",
  "importance": 0.0 to 1.0
}

If nothing relevant:
{
  "status": "dismissed",
  "output": "",
  "importance": 0.5
}`
}
