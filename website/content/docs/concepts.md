This page is the canonical mental model for Adapt. The guide pages assume you've read it — they jump straight into API usage rather than re-explaining the concepts here.

## Architecture

Adapt has two building blocks: **Brain** (an orchestrator) and **Neurons** (specialists). A Brain contains neurons, routes data to them, and synthesizes answers across them. Each neuron independently learns from the data it sees and builds its own understanding.

## Learning Pipeline

When data flows into a neuron (via `learn()` on a standalone neuron, or `inject()` on a Brain), it goes through two phases:

1. **Observe** — the neuron decides what's relevant. An LLM reads each item against the neuron's purpose and filters out what doesn't belong. Relevant items become observations, each scored by importance (0–1). Irrelevant items are dismissed but tracked, so the system can detect coverage gaps over time. Observations are buffered until there are enough to synthesize.

2. **Understand** — once enough observations have accumulated (controlled by configurable thresholds — observation count or token count), the neuron synthesizes them into knowledge. How this works depends on the neuron type. Each synthesis produces a significance rating (`routine`, `notable`, `critical`).

**Querying** is separate from learning: when you ask a question, the LLM reads the neuron's accumulated understanding and answers with relevance and confidence scores. It doesn't re-process raw data.

## Brain vs Standalone

| | Use this when |
|---|---|
| **Brain** (`Brain.create`) | You want auto-decomposition into multiple specialists, parallel routing, multi-neuron synthesis, and evolution. |
| **Standalone neuron** (`TextNeuron.create`, `ListNeuron.create`) | You only need one domain and want direct control. No orchestration, no evolution. |

Standalone neurons are first-class — they expose the same `learn` / `query` / `update` / `adjust` surface a Brain calls into. Most examples on this site use a Brain because that's the more common starting point.

## Neuron Types

| | TextNeuron | ListNeuron |
|---|---|---|
| **Understanding format** | Narrative prose (string) | Structured collection (items with schema) |
| **How synthesis works** | LLM integrates observations into one evolving text | LLM agent uses add/update/remove tools to manage items |
| **Schema** | N/A | Auto-generated from instructions (or provided manually) |
| **Confidence scoring** | LLM-judged per query ("how well can I answer this?") | Evidence-based — items referenced more often score higher |
| **Pattern recognition** | Detects confirmation, contradiction, recurrence, intensification, avoidance, and other dynamics | N/A — item management only |
| **Growth control** | Strategy (`continuous`, `cumulative`, `decay`) + token limit | Deduplication + max items + pruning policy |

**Rule of thumb:** narrative answer → TextNeuron. Table or list of items → ListNeuron. When Brain auto-decomposes a prompt, the LLM chooses per domain and defaults to TextNeuron when in doubt.

## Evolution

The neuron structure isn't static. As data arrives and queries flow in, neurons can become overloaded, overlap, or leave gaps. Evolution is the loop that lets a Brain reshape itself: **signal → evaluate → act**.

- **Signals** flag that something might need to change. Three sources: automatic (neuron health — high dismissal, low confidence, stagnation), coverage gaps (no neuron could process / answer), and developer-injected via `brain.signal({ source, description })`.
- **Evaluator** is an LLM agent that triggers when signals accumulate (default threshold: 5). It inspects neurons, queries their knowledge, and consults internal neurons before deciding what to do.
- **Actions** the evaluator can take: **create**, **merge**, **split**, **update**, or **delete** neurons.

Brain also runs four **internal neurons** that track meta-knowledge about the system itself — cross-domain patterns (Global Understanding), query topics (Global Query Understanding), data nothing could process (Injection Gaps), questions nothing could answer (Query Gaps). The evaluator consults them; you can too via `brain.consult()`.

## Steering

Three distinct verbs cover the steering surface. They are not interchangeable:

| Verb | What it feeds | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `inject(data)` | Data — runs through observe → understand | Routine — you have new information |
| `signal({ source, description })` | Metadata — feeds the evolution evaluator | "We need a neuron for X" / "These two overlap" / "Restructure now" |
| `adjustNeuron(id, directive)` / `neuron.adjust()` | Natural-language steering for one neuron | "Stop tracking desktop" / "Be stricter about distinct topics" |
| `update(config)` | Mechanical config replacement (models, thresholds, prompt) | Threshold tuning, model swap, semantic prompt change |

Data goes through `inject`. Structural change goes through `signal`. Per-neuron behavior tweaks go through `adjust`. Mechanical config changes go through `update`.
